# Object Oriented Javascript 
## About project
This project is made to synthesize knowledge about Object-Oriented Javascript
## what it does
The project is an infographic that is derived from data that is provided, as well as user input data. Object-oriented javascript is great for working with complex data, but itâ€™s not of much use without an interface to interact with. You will be pulling in information from a form and using it to complete an array of objects that will then be appended back to the DOM. 

## how to run it
You can run it by using live server (a visual studio code extension) or open index.html file by your browser
